## PROJECT

Your project is finishing and submitting the lab from streaming module (module 3). It is an **individual** project.
The deadline is **31/12/2022**. Export your notebook from the Databricks and send it to
**pkaferledevisschere@omnesintervenant.com**.

Rquirements:
- your use case needs to make sense:
    - describe what your **initial question** is and how you will answer it based on the data 
    - describe why you selected specific grouping, window, watermark...
- make the notebook **linearly executable** (all the cells can be executed one after the other, without going back to the previous cell at any point)
- make it **readable**. Write comments or markdown text to briefly describe what you did.
